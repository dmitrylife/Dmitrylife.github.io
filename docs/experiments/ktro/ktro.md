# KTRO — Klimov Tarpen Robotic Observatory

KTRO (Klimov Tarpen Robotic Observatory) is a small-scale semi-automated
observational facility developed as part of the Psi–Continuum
Experimental Program.

The purpose of KTRO is not survey-scale astronomy, but reproducible,
long-term differential photometry focused on stability testing,
instrument consistency, and cross-epoch robustness.

## Scientific Role within the Psi–Continuum Program

Within the broader framework, KTRO serves as a controlled
macroscopic testbed.

While the cosmological part of the Psi–Continuum project analyzes
large public datasets (SN Ia, BAO, H(z)), KTRO operates at a vastly
smaller physical scale but under the same guiding principle:

> Stability, response, and long-term consistency of observational data.

The observatory allows systematic testing of:

- Differential photometric stability
- Cross-instrument reproducibility
- Long-term drift control
- Noise behavior under repeated measurements
- Pipeline-level robustness

Small systems provide insight into measurement structure.

## Observational Focus

The primary targets are:

- RR Lyrae stars  
- Cepheid variables  
- Stable reference stars for baseline monitoring  

The observational protocol emphasizes:

- Differential photometry
- Standard calibration frames (bias, dark, flat)
- Fixed reduction pipeline
- Version-controlled data processing
- Archivable output formats

The objective is not discovery, but reproducibility.

---

## Instrumental Baseline

KTRO is based on a mechanically stable equatorial platform
(MaxVision EXOS-2 class mount) prepared for progressive automation.

The facility is designed to support:

- Semi-automated tracking
- Scheduled long-term monitoring
- Remote-safe operation
- Standardized data archiving

Automation development proceeds in phases.

## Development Phases

**Phase 1 — Mechanical validation (completed)**  
Mount assembly, alignment testing, tracking validation.

**Phase 2 — Semi-automation (ongoing)**  
Motor control refinement, repeatable pointing routines,
pipeline integration.

**Phase 3 — Full long-term monitoring mode (planned)**  
Scheduled multi-month observation programs,
cross-season consistency checks.

---

## Reproducibility

All observational data and reduction steps are intended to be:

- Documented
- Version-controlled
- Pipeline-reproducible
- Open where feasible

The experimental program is methodological in nature.
It does not aim to compete with professional observatories,
but to explore response diagnostics under controlled,
small-scale conditions.

---

## Conceptual Perspective

The cosmological component of the Psi–Continuum framework
analyzes large-scale expansion histories.

KTRO operates at the opposite scale.

The connection is conceptual:

Measurement systems — whether cosmic or local —
must exhibit stability, response structure, and
controlled deviations.

Understanding small systems informs interpretation
of large datasets.

## Status

KTRO is currently in Phase 2 (semi-automation development).

First structured long-term monitoring campaigns
are planned for the Nemansky region sky.
