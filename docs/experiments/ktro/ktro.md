# KTRO — Klimov Tarpen Robotic Observatory

KTRO (Klimov Tarpen Robotic Observatory) is a small-scale,
semi-automated observational facility developed within the
Psi–Continuum Experimental Program.

Its purpose is not survey-scale astronomy or object discovery.
KTRO is designed as a controlled photometric stability platform,
focused on long-term reproducibility, instrumental consistency,
and methodological robustness.

## Scientific Function within the Psi–Continuum Program

The Psi–Continuum framework operates at two scales:

- Large-scale cosmological background diagnostics  
- Small-scale controlled observational stability tests  

KTRO serves as a macroscopic experimental testbed for
measurement-system behavior.

While cosmological analyses rely on public datasets
(SN Ia, BAO, H(z)), KTRO allows controlled repetition
of measurements under known instrumental conditions.

The objective is methodological:

- Evaluate differential photometric stability  
- Quantify long-term instrumental drift  
- Test cross-epoch reproducibility  
- Characterize noise structure under repeated measurements  
- Validate pipeline-level robustness  

The guiding principle is consistent across scales:

> Measurement systems must demonstrate stability, response coherence,
> and controlled deviations.

## Observational Scope

Primary targets:

- RR Lyrae stars  
- Classical Cepheids  
- Stable reference stars for baseline control  

Observational protocol emphasizes:

- Differential photometry  
- Standard calibration frames (bias, dark, flat)  
- Fixed and version-controlled reduction pipeline  
- Archivable and reproducible output formats  
- Cross-night consistency monitoring  

The objective is reproducibility rather than discovery.

## Instrumentation

### Mount
- MaxVision EXOS-2 (equatorial mount)  
- OnStep V4 Pro controller  

### Optical System
- Sky-Watcher BKP 150/750 (Newtonian, f/5)  
- Baader MPCC Mark III coma corrector  

### Camera
- ZWO ASI533MM Pro (monochrome CMOS)  

### Filters
- UBVRI Bessel set (V2)  

### Focusing
- ZWO EAF (with temperature sensor)  

The system is designed for mechanical stability,
repeatable pointing, and progressive automation.

## Calibration Strategy

KTRO employs a standardized calibration procedure:

- Bias and dark frame libraries under temperature control  
- Nightly flat-field acquisition  
- Fixed reduction workflow  
- Version-controlled processing scripts  

All reduction steps are documented and reproducible.

---

## Development Phases

**Phase 1 — Mechanical validation (completed)**  
Mount assembly, polar alignment testing, tracking validation.

**Phase 2 — Semi-automation (ongoing)**  
Repeatable pointing routines, motor control refinement,
pipeline integration.

**Phase 3 — Long-term monitoring mode (planned)**  
Multi-month monitoring programs, cross-season stability checks,
public data documentation where feasible.

---

## Reproducibility Policy

All observational procedures are:

- Documented  
- Version-controlled  
- Pipeline-reproducible  
- Archivable  

The program is methodological and complementary to
professional observatories.

It aims to explore response diagnostics and stability structure
under controlled small-scale conditions.

---

## Conceptual Position

The cosmological component of the Psi–Continuum framework
analyzes expansion histories of the Universe.

KTRO operates at the opposite physical scale.

The connection is methodological rather than physical:

Controlled small systems provide insight into
measurement stability, response structure,
and interpretation discipline.

---

## Status

KTRO is currently in Phase 2 (semi-automation development).

Structured long-term monitoring campaigns are planned
for the Nemansky region sky.
