# Experimental observations (Pilot program)

> 🇷🇺 Full observational protocol (Russian): [here](index.en)

This page describes a small observational pilot program within the
**Psi-Continuum framework**.

The goal of the program is **not astrophysical discovery**, but the study of
**reproducibility, stability, and consistency** of real observational data
under realistic ground-based conditions.

The pilot is based on long-term observations performed by
**independent amateur astronomers and small private observatories**.

> No specialized professional equipment is required.

## Program concept

We deliberately focus on **smooth, well-understood astrophysical signals**
and examine how they appear when measured:

- on different nights,
- with different instruments,
- by different observers,
- under non-ideal atmospheric conditions.

This allows us to probe **instrumental and procedural systematics**
that are usually suppressed or averaged out in large professional surveys.

---

## Observational target

The program uses **classical variable stars** as controlled reference signals:

- **RR Lyrae stars**
- **Classical Cepheids**

These objects provide stable, periodic light curves that serve as
natural test functions for long-term photometric consistency.

Typical magnitude range:  
**V ≈ 7–12**

## Observational method

The recommended task is:

**Long-term differential photometry of a single variable star**,  
with explicit control of measurement stability.

Key features:

- differential (not absolute) photometry,
- 2–3 comparison stars in the same field,
- moderate precision (0.01–0.03 mag is sufficient),
- emphasis on **repeatability rather than maximal accuracy**.

---

## Scientific motivation

Modern cosmology increasingly relies on the **global consistency**
of heterogeneous datasets rather than on individual measurements.

This pilot addresses a complementary question:

> *How smooth and stable do observational signals remain when measured
> under realistic, ground-level conditions, outside idealized pipelines?*

The results are relevant for:
- data consistency studies,
- systematic-error assessment,
- methodological discussions in late-time cosmology.

## Participation and documentation

The **full observational protocol and participation guidelines**
are currently documented in **Russian**, as the pilot program
targets a local observational community.
