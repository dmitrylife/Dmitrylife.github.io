# ⭐ Recommended observational targets  
*(Global participation)*

This page lists **variable stars** well suited for long-term differential
photometry within the Psi-Continuum observational pilot.

The targets are intentionally chosen to be:
- well-studied and physically smooth,
- observable with small to medium amateur telescopes,
- suitable for long-term, repeatable monitoring,
- easy to combine across different observers and locations.

The scientific goal is **not stellar astrophysics**, but
**testing the reproducibility and stability of observational data**
under realistic conditions.

## 🔴 RR Lyrae stars

RR Lyrae stars have short periods and relatively large amplitudes,
making them excellent reference signals for consistency tests.

---

### **RR Lyrae**
- Constellation: **Lyra**
- Magnitude range: **V ≈ 7.1 – 8.1**
- Period: **~0.57 days**
- Visibility: observable from most northern latitudes

**Comment:**  
A classical reference object. Suitable even for first test observations.

---

### **X Arietis**
- Constellation: **Aries**
- Magnitude range: **V ≈ 9.5 – 10.4**
- Period: **~0.65 days**
- Visibility: autumn–winter (northern hemisphere)

**Comment:**  
Convenient for winter observing windows.

---

### **RV Ursae Majoris**
- Constellation: **Ursa Major**
- Magnitude range: **V ≈ 9.8 – 10.9**
- Period: **~0.47 days**
- Visibility: circumpolar for many northern observers

**Comment:**  
Especially suitable for automated or semi-automated setups.

---

## 🔵 Classical Cepheids

Classical Cepheids have longer periods and exceptionally smooth
light curves, ideal for long-term stability tests.

---

### **δ Cephei**
- Constellation: **Cepheus**
- Magnitude range: **V ≈ 3.5 – 4.4**
- Period: **~5.4 days**
- Visibility: northern hemisphere

**Comment:**  
Very bright object. Short exposures or mild defocusing may be required.

---

### **η Aquilae**
- Constellation: **Aquila**
- Magnitude range: **V ≈ 3.5 – 4.4**
- Period: **~7.2 days**
- Visibility: summer months (both hemispheres)

**Comment:**  
Well suited for testing long-period stability.

---

### **RT Aurigae**
- Constellation: **Auriga**
- Magnitude range: **V ≈ 5.0 – 5.8**
- Period: **~3.7 days**
- Visibility: winter–spring (northern hemisphere)

**Comment:**  
Convenient for winter observing campaigns.

## 🌍 Choosing targets worldwide

Participants are **not limited to the list above**.

You may select any RR Lyrae star or classical Cepheid that:
- lies in the magnitude range **V ≈ 7–12** (or brighter with short exposures),
- is well observable from your latitude,
- has **2–3 stable comparison stars** in the same field,
- can be monitored repeatedly over several weeks.

If uncertain, participants are encouraged to **contact the project coordinator**
to agree on a suitable target.

---

## ✅ Practical recommendations

- Choose **one target per observing season**
- Do not switch targets mid-series
- Regularity and repeatability matter more than phase coverage
- One well-observed object is more valuable than many sparse datasets

For automated systems:
- prefer targets with long visibility windows,
- minimize configuration changes during the campaign.

---

## ⚠️ Important notes

- Extremely high precision is not required
- Absolute photometric calibration is not necessary
- Realistic observing conditions are part of the experiment
