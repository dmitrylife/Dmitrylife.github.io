# Psi-Continuum Theory Overview

Psi-Continuum (ΨCDM) is a one-parameter phenomenological extension of ΛCDM.

Background expansion:

```mathematica
E²(z) = Ω_m (1 + z)³ + (1 − Ω_m) · [1 + ε₀ · g(z)]
```

Where:

- ε₀ controls smooth late-time deviation  
- g(z) is chosen such that g(0) = 1 and deviations vanish at high z  
- ΨCDM → ΛCDM at ε₀ = 0

The model preserves early-time physics while modifying the low-z expansion history.

Figures and detailed derivations will be added later.
