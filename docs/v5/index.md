# Psi–Continuum Cosmology v5  
## A Macroscopic State–Space Response Framework for Late–Time Cosmic Expansion

## Overview

Psi–Continuum Cosmology v5 introduces a macroscopic state–space framework
for describing late–time cosmic expansion.

The approach is intentionally conservative and purely phenomenological.
It does not introduce new dynamical fields, modify gravitational dynamics,
or perform parameter estimation.

Instead, late–time expansion data are organized using a single
macroscopic diagnostic coordinate, **Ψ(z)**, defined directly from ratios
of background expansion histories relative to a reference ΛCDM state.

---

## Conceptual Motivation

Late–time cosmic acceleration is inferred from global, integrated
observables rather than from local dynamical measurements.

Psi–Continuum v5 adopts a macroscopic viewpoint:
the cosmological background is treated as a global system, and deviations
from ΛCDM are interpreted as a **macroscopic response** rather than as the
effect of an additional physical component.

Within this framework:

- ΛCDM corresponds to an **instantaneous–response limit**
- Observed deviations correspond to small, history–dependent deformations
- No microscopic mechanism is assumed or required at this stage

---

## The State–Space Coordinate Ψ(z)

The macroscopic state–space coordinate is defined as:

\[
\Psi(z) \equiv \frac{H(z)}{H_{\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}}(z)} - 1
\]

where:
- \(H(z)\) is a reconstructed or model background expansion history
- \(H_{\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}}(z)\) is a fixed reference background

Ψ(z) is:
- dimensionless
- purely diagnostic
- defined at the background level
- insensitive to local perturbative dynamics

---

## Observational Diagnostics

When applied to late–time observational constraints:

- Independent datasets form a compact family of smooth trajectories in Ψ–space
- Deviations from ΛCDM remain at the sub–percent level
- The joint solution occupies a central region in state space

This behaviour suggests that late–time acceleration can be consistently
characterized as a **small, coherent macroscopic deformation** of the
background expansion history.

## Reproducibility and Software

All results presented in Psi–Continuum Cosmology v5 are fully reproducible.

A companion open–source software package implements the state–space
diagnostics described in the article:

**psi–continuum–statespace**  
https://github.com/dmitrylife/psi-continuum-statespace

The software provides:
- construction of Ψ(z) trajectories
- state–space consistency diagnostics
- reproducible figure generation

---

## Scope and Limitations

Psi–Continuum v5 is intentionally restricted to:

- background–level expansion history
- diagnostic and organizational analysis
- phenomenological interpretation

It does **not**:
- propose a microscopic origin of acceleration
- modify gravity or conservation laws
- address perturbations or structure formation

These directions are left for future work.

## Relation to Previous Versions

- **v1–v3:** phenomenological exploration and model construction  
- **v4:** response–based conceptual reformulation  
- **v5:** state–space diagnostic framework and synthesis

Psi–Continuum v5 represents a shift from model building toward a
macroscopic, response–based description of cosmic expansion.
