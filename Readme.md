# Psi–Continuum

**Psi–Continuum** is an open research framework exploring late–time cosmic expansion
using macroscopic, diagnostic state–space methods.

This repository hosts the **official project website**:
👉 https://psi-continuum.org/

---

## Project scope

Psi–Continuum is **not a new fundamental theory** and does not introduce
additional forces, fields, or modified gravity.

The project focuses on:

- macroscopic, background–level descriptions of cosmic expansion,
- diagnostic reconstruction of expansion histories,
- state–space representations of late–time acceleration,
- reproducible links between observational data, analysis code, and publications.

## Website contents

The website provides:

- 📘 **Documentation** for Psi–Continuum software packages  
- 📄 **Scientific articles and preprints** (Zenodo DOIs)
- 🧪 **Companion diagnostic tools** and reproducible pipelines
- 🔭 **Experimental and observational demonstrations**
- 📦 Versioned documentation (`v2`, `v5`, …)
