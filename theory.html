<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This is a research project. All results are presented as preprints and diagnostic studies.</p>

<p>
    The <strong>Psi-Continuum</strong> is a developing theoretical framework exploring the idea that
    certain features of space-time structure, gravitational behavior, and late-time
    cosmic expansion may be understood as macroscopic, system-level responses,
    rather than as fundamental source terms.
</p>

<p>
    This page provides a general conceptual overview.
    The technical development, numerical analysis, and detailed formulation
    are presented in the corresponding preprints listed below.
</p>

<h2>Publication Status</h2>

<p>
    The Psi–Continuum framework is currently presented as a series of interrelated preprints,
    reflecting the sequential development of the phenomenological, interpretational,
    and macroscopic state–space levels of the theory.

<!-- Preprint v2 -->
<p>
    Version 2 represents a major technical revision of the Ψ-Cosmology framework.
    It introduces a minimal one-parameter late-time deformation of ΛCDM, provides
    full background-expansion tests using SN Ia, H(z), SDSS and DESI DR2 BAO,
    and includes a complete reproducible pipeline.

<!-- Preprint v3 -->
<p>
    While <strong>Psi–Continuum v2</strong> focused on a strictly reproducible,
    background-level comparison with ΛCDM using modern observational datasets,
    the third release shifts emphasis toward physical interpretation.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Version 3</strong> does not introduce new data or parameter fitting.
    Instead, it provides a conceptual reinterpretation of the Ψ-deformation
    as an effective macroscopic response field governing late-time cosmic expansion.
    The paper is intentionally interpretational and complementary to v2.

<!-- Preprint v4 -->
<p>
    <strong>Psi–Continuum Cosmology v4</strong> represents the conceptual culmination
    of the response-based approach developed in previous releases.
    It reformulates late-time cosmic acceleration in terms of a macroscopic
    state–space response framework, introducing a geometric and thermodynamic
    interpretation of background expansion.
</p>

<p>
    Rather than introducing new physical fields or modifying gravity,
    the expansion history is described as an irreversible relaxation process
    in the space of cosmological states, governed by dissipation, memory,
    and response geometry. The ΛCDM configuration emerges as a stable
    stationary state of the macroscopic dynamics.

<p>
    <strong>Psi–Continuum Cosmology v5</strong> represents a consolidation and
    formal clarification of the state–space perspective introduced in earlier
    releases. Rather than extending the conceptual framework further, this work
    focuses on a strictly diagnostic formulation of late–time cosmic expansion
    in terms of macroscopic state–space variables.
</p>

<p>
    The v5 framework introduces a single kinematical state–space coordinate,
    defined directly from ratios of background expansion histories relative to
    a ΛCDM reference state. This construction is purely phenomenological and
    deliberately avoids the introduction of new dynamical degrees of freedom,
    modified gravity, or microscopic model assumptions.
</p>

<p>
    Within this formulation, observational constraints are organized as smooth
    trajectories in an abstract state space, allowing direct assessment of
    internal consistency between independent late–time datasets. The ΛCDM
    model emerges naturally as the instantaneous–response limit of the
    macroscopic description, while observed deviations correspond to small,
    coherent deformations of the background expansion history.

<!-- Planned -->
<h2>Ongoing and Future Directions</h2>

<p>
    With the publication of <strong>Psi–Continuum Cosmology v5</strong>,
    the core macroscopic state–space formulation of the Psi–Continuum framework
    is considered complete at the background level.
</p>

<p>
    Future work will focus on extending the framework beyond descriptive
    diagnostics toward deeper theoretical and observational questions, including:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Connections between macroscopic state–space structure and microscopic dynamics</li>
    <li>Possible links to non-equilibrium physics, coarse-graining, and emergent gravity</li>
    <li>Extensions of the state–space approach to perturbations and structure formation</li>
    <li>Comparison with future high-precision late-time datasets</li>
</ul>

<p class="titlesmall">
    These developments will be presented as standalone thematic studies rather than
    sequential versioned releases.
