# When data prefers a direction in state space

In many physical problems, directionality is introduced by hand:
a force term, a potential, or an explicit equation of motion.

But sometimes **direction emerges directly from the data**.

When independent observations populate a narrow family of trajectories in an abstract
state space, and these trajectories consistently point toward a specific region,
the system exhibits a preferred direction — even without specifying underlying dynamics.

This is the language of **attractors**.

---

# Attractors as data-driven structures

In dynamical systems, an attractor is not defined by a force, but by behavior:

- trajectories from different initial conditions converge,
- deviations decay rather than amplify,
- the system forgets its detailed past.

Crucially, **an attractor can be identified without knowing the microscopic equations**.

All that is required is a state-space description and sufficiently consistent trajectories.

---

## From equations to diagnostics

Consider a system described by abstract state variables $(X, Y)$.

If the data trace trajectories that spiral inward toward a stable point, we infer:

$$
\frac{dS}{dt} \propto -\nabla \Phi(S)
$$

without ever specifying what $\Phi$ is.

The direction is inferred **empirically**, not postulated.

This is fundamentally different from introducing a new force term.

---

# A minimal illustration

The figure below shows a **purely diagnostic example**:
a trajectory in state space approaching a stable attractor.

- No force law is assumed.
- No physical interpretation is attached to $X$ or $Y$.
- Only the structure matters.

What we see is:

- a preferred direction in state space,
- decay of excursions,
- convergence toward a stationary point.

That alone is enough to define an attractor.

---

# Why this matters for cosmology (and beyond)

When late-time cosmological data form:

- smooth,
- coherent,
- sub-percent trajectories,
- consistent across probes,

the natural question is not “*what force causes this?*”
but rather:

> *What structure in state space are the data revealing?*

In this view, acceleration is not necessarily a source term —
it may be the **macroscopic signature of relaxation toward a stable state**.

---

# A note on interpretation

An attractor is not a claim about fundamental dynamics.

It is a statement about organization.

Just as entropy increase defines an arrow of time without invoking a new interaction,
a preferred direction in data-defined state space does not require a new force.

It requires only consistency.

## Closing thought

When data consistently choose a direction,
the most economical explanation is not always a new force.

Sometimes, the system is simply telling us **where equilibrium lies**.
