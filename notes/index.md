# Conceptual and Interpretational Notes

These notes provide interpretational context for the Psi-Continuum framework.

They do not introduce new models, parameters, equations, or predictions.
All quantitative results are contained in the associated preprints and
reproducible computational releases.

The purpose of this section is to clarify language, intuition,
and levels of description used throughout the framework.

Analogies are used as explanatory tools only.
