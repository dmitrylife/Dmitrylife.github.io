# Conceptual and Interpretational Notes

These notes provide interpretational and conceptual context for the Psi-Continuum framework.

They do not introduce new models, parameters, equations, or predictions.
They do not propose modifications of known physical laws.
They do not replace the formal development presented in the associated preprints.

The purpose of these notes is to clarify language, intuition,
and levels of description used in the framework, and to explain why certain phenomena may admit
effective or emergent interpretations without implying new fundamental interactions.

Analogies are used only as explanatory tools, not as sources of derivation or evidence.
All quantitative results, tests, and claims remain confined to the peer-reviewed and archived technical work.

These notes are intended for readers interested in how to think about the framework,
not in extending or validating it beyond its stated scope.
